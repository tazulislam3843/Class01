	<h1>This is Tazul Islam</h1>
	<p>At first I want to remind you about a poem "Ode to the west wind" by P.B. Shelley that the west wind not only destroys but also presents somthething new as gifts.For example, it spreads new seeds here and there and those grew up as big trees once.
	Similarly, Corona is just like a west wind and it is not only taking many lives but also giving some oppotunities to earn one's bread like free-lancing. 
	So i want to take this opprtunity through a co-operative teacher- Farid Rony. I think he will give me a change to be a effective free-lancer although i have some difficulties.
	I wish i could overcome those difficulties. I wiil try my level best to be a good free-lancer.

	After all...
	I am Tazul islam. I am working as a free-lancer. As a fresher i wish to be a great free-lancer in the world.
